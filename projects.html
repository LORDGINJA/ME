								The first project I coded was a 3 page website on alligators and crocodiles.  I did it in the 9th grade, taking me about a month.  I used HTML5 and CSS, as I was just learning how to code. It looked ok for a begginer's website, but it was very plain and boring.  Once I learned more intricate coding (still HTML5 and CSS) however, I took all of the content from my first website and put it into a new one that I created, which looked much better.

								My second project, still 9th grade but second sememester, was a remake of a game called Cookieclicker, which took me about two months.  Cookieclicker is exactly what it sounds like: a game in which you click a cookie.  This project included HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. I was allowed only to look at the game and guess the code.  As simple as this sounds, I was new to Java and found it kind of difficult.  In the end, however, I managed to make a very good copy, looking and working very similarly to the actual game.
