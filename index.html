								I was born February 25, 1999 in Pasadena, California.  I have lived here in Pasadena my whole life, though I have traveled to many places, including Germany, Italy, Mexico, and various states. I went to Hamilton Elementary School for Pre-K to 5th grade, then Wilson Middle School for 6th though 8th grade, and finally PHS, where I am currently in the 10th grade. At PHS, I am enrolled in the APP Academy.

								I like to consider myyself a well-rounded person.  I like education, but I also like sports and other outdoor activities and T.V. and other indoor activities.  I am mostly interested in Science, particularly Biology. I run Cross Country and Track competively, but also like to play soccer and ride my bike.  I love going hiking and camping.  I don't really believe in hate, but I have made two exceptions: fish(as food) and artificial grape flavoring. I cannot stand those things and when anyone asks if I want any or try to give me some I tell them I'm allergic.
